This was a setup we made for local comic/anime conventions. We sold cheap plastic pokeballs with NFC stickers we placed inside. The stickers would point to the url this was deployed at and upon being scanned by any smart phone, the phone would display the pokemon sprite, and using websockets, instruct the web display we had at our booth to do the same and play the Pokemon cry over the speakers. People would buy the pokeballs, and see what was inside. We used NFC tools to set the urls in the stickers and would try to match the Pokemon to cool ones it seemed like the kids wanted. It was fun!
